/**
 * A configuration file editing tool
 *
 * Augeas parses a configuration file in its native format using a "lens" and
 * transforms it into a tree. Configuration changes are made by manipulating
 * this tree and saving it back into the native configuration file.
 *
 *  * ''Home'': [[http://augeas.net/]]
 *  * ''C-Documentation'': [[http://augeas.net/docs/references/c_api/files/augeas-h.html]]
 *
 * == Loading a Configuration File into the Tree ==
 *
 * The following example uses a //hosts// file. A hosts file maps network host
 * names to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. For Unix systems this is usually
 * located at /etc/hosts
 * {{{
 * void main () {
 *    var tree = new Augeas.Tree ();
 *    tree.transform ("hosts", "/etc/hosts");
 *    tree.load ();
 *    tree.print ();
 * }
 * }}}
 * The example creates an instance of Augeas.Tree and then adds a transform to
 * the tree using the "hosts" lens for the file "/etc/hosts". A tree can
 * have many transforms. There are also many lenses available for parsing
 * different types of configuration files. The Augeas website has a list of
 * [[http://augeas.net/stock_lenses.html|stock lenses]].
 *
 * The configuration file is then loaded in to the tree using the specified
 * lens. The print () call shows how the tree is structured with the
 * transformed configuration file.
